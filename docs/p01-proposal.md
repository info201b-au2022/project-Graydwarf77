### Abstract
Our main question is suicide rates among adolescents in US. This question is important because concern about mental health issues among adolescents has increased worldwide and adolescents account for a growing share of suicide rates. To address the question, we will collect and count data on this topic, then analyze and hypothesize how we can reduce the stress of adolescents.

### Keywords
- Suicide
- Causes for Suicide
- Death Rate
- Age Range
- Mental Health

## Introduction
The biggest concern for adolescents around the world today is suicide due to stress and mental health issues. According to a study of 14 U.S. states published in the JAMA Pediatrics: Adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 accounted for 6.5 percent of all suicides in 2020, a dramatic increase from previous years. Also, according to the National Foundation for Suicide Prevention, suicide is the third leading cause of death for adolescents and the second leading cause of death for college students. Adolescents commit suicide for many reasons, both internal and external. We collected data, explored, and classified them, summed up the main reasons for suicide by adolescents and wanted to urge everyone to effectively avoid them.

## Problem Domain
<<<<<<< HEAD
If one were to take a survey of adolescents around the world asking what their biggest concern was, there is a good chance that a many would say that they are over stressed and feel trapped in a dying world. This outlook, one of hopelessness and desperation, is likely to have contributed to the massive mental health and subsequently suicidal ideation crisis that plagues much of the world today. To paint an idea of the scope of the issue, Jane Brody of the New York Times reports “the rate of suicide among those aged 10 to 24 increased dramatically — by 56 percent — between 2007 and 2017”, a deeply troubling increase (Brody, 2019). Furthermore, the World Health Organization has found that “Depression is one of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents, and suicide is the second leading cause of death in people aged 15–19 years” (Adolescents and Young, 2022). There is a severe mental health crisis that is crippling the youth of the world, and it is our responsibility to act, and do what we can to shed light on this issue.
### Human Values
 The future health of an entire generation is at stake, and countless communities are at risk of falling apart if this ever-growing crisis is not addressed. Despite this, many still value privacy and status over mental health, aiming to sweep the issue under the rug as previous generations have. This has actively harmed many youths struggling with mental health or a mental illness, as nearly 60% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment (The State, 2022). Despite the pushback on mental health education and treatment, the time has come to treat the values of mental health and community with the respect they deserve.
### Direct and Indirect stakeholders
 The most obvious direct stakeholders of this issue include adolescents and their families. Their experiences and values towards this topic vary to an extreme extent, leading to a plethora of different approaches to the suicidal ideation crisis. When one considers indirect stakeholders, it would be easier to name who is not one, as anybody who interacts with these direct stakeholders will be affected in some way because of how mental illness affects every facet of a direct stakeholder’s life.
### Potential Benefits and Harms
  Data scientists must be extremely careful with technology surrounding the issue of suicidal ideation. Technology can be exceedingly useful in both treatment and research efforts when it comes to the mental health crisis, but they must be cautious not to turn the unique stories of the millions of adolescents that are suffering from suicidal ideation into simple numbers. Ultimately, every person is at a different state when it comes to their mental health, and professionals seeking to utilize technology to fight suicidal ideation must keep this thought in mind if they want to be successful.

## Research Questions

## The Dataset

## Expected Implications
Assuming these research questions are answered, technologists, designers, and policymakers will have to find ways to modify and improve the currently available mental health resources in the United States. To do this, they will need to analyze the more improved mental health infrastructures that were found in other countries around the world through our findings. If a discrepancy in suicide rates amongst male and female adolescents is found, mental health resources must also be altered to compensate and cater toward the minoritized group. Not only should the United States’ mental health resources be reformed and advanced, but technologists and designers and other innovators should be working towards removing any aspects of their creations that are harmful to users’ mental health. These creations, such as social media, school systems, and other aspects of our society should instead work towards a positive environment for adolescents’ mental health to thrive in, using the analyses found.

## Limitations
There are some limitations that need to be addressed regarding the research behind comparing and analyzing suicide rates. Firstly, when comparing suicide rates in the United States to suicide rates in countries around the world, we cannot consider all the countries in the world. We will have to narrow down and only include a sample of the nations across the globe. Another limitation would be if a country is found to have a high rate of mental health resources, it cannot be immediately assumed that their infrastructure for dealing with mental illness is better than others. There are possibilities that they have a low quality of mental health resources, even though they have the high quantity; or, their mental health resources could be of high quality, but more focused toward other mental illnesses unrelated to suicide. So, the data for this question would have to be considered more carefully to really get to the root of the issue with a country’s mental health resources.
