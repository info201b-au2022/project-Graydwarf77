##### Crude Suicide Rates Data

The _Crude Suicide Rates_ data was collected from Twinkle Khanna. The data was published two years ago and was gathered for the year 2016. While the funder of the dataset is not stated, the publisher displays strong feelings for suicide prevention. Therefore, the dataset may be intended to spread awareness about the rates of suicide in hopes for greater suicide prevention. Since the source of the data is the World Health Organization (WHO), the data is likely to be valid and credible. The WHO holds a high standard for the technical accuracy of data, making the _Crude Suicide Rates_ dataset trustworthy. This dataset was obtained through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a platform for data scientists to publish various datasets. Since much of the data displayed in Kaggle has been provided by Data Scientists and Analysts, the majority of the data is credible.
