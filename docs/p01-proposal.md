### Abstract
Our main question is suicide rates among adolescents. This question is important because adolescents account for an increasing proportion of suicide rates. To address the question, we will. . .

## Introduction
According to a study of 14 U.S. states published in the JAMA Pediatrics: Adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 accounted for 6.5 percent of all suicides in 2020, a dramatic increase from previous years. Also, according to the National Foundation for Suicide Prevention, suicide is the third leading cause of death for adolescents and the second leading cause of death for college students. Adolescents commit suicide for many reasons, both internal and external. We collected data, explored, and classified them, summed up the main reasons for suicide by adolescents and wanted to urge everyone to effectively avoid them.

## Problem Domain

## Research Questions

## The Dataset

## Expected Implications
Assuming these research questions are answered, technologists, designers, and policymakers will have to find ways to modify and improve the currently available mental health resources in the United States. To do this, they will need to analyze the more improved mental health infrastructures that were found in other countries around the world through our findings. If a discrepancy in suicide rates amongst male and female adolescents is found, mental health resources must also be altered to compensate and cater toward the minoritized group. Not only should the United States’ mental health resources be reformed and advanced, but technologists and designers and other innovators should be working towards removing any aspects of their creations that are harmful to users’ mental health. These creations, such as social media, school systems, and other aspects of our society should instead work towards a positive environment for adolescents’ mental health to thrive in, using the analyses found.

## Limitations
There are some limitations that need to be addressed regarding the research behind comparing and analyzing suicide rates. Firstly, when comparing suicide rates in the United States to suicide rates in countries around the world, we cannot consider all the countries in the world. We will have to narrow down and only include a sample of the nations across the globe. Another limitation would be if a country is found to have a high rate of mental health resources, it cannot be immediately assumed that their infrastructure for dealing with mental illness is better than others. There are possibilities that they have a low quality of mental health resources, even though they have the high quantity; or, their mental health resources could be of high quality, but more focused toward other mental illnesses unrelated to suicide. So, the data for this question would have to be considered more carefully to really get to the root of the issue with a country’s mental health resources.
