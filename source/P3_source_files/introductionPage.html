<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Suicide is the third leading cause of death for adolescents, and the second leading cause of death for college students, according to the National Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Mental health - especially in relation to suicide - is considered an uncomfortable topic for most. For this reason and many others, it remains an issue that has not been addressed properly in the past. Because suicide is not talked about more frequently, it is not a widely understood topic. We decided to collect and analyze data surrounding suicide among adolescents to better understand the issue, and provide better insight toward it.</p>

<h2>Research Questions</h2>

<p>There were three significant questions we wanted to answer through our data:</p>

<ol>

  <li>How do suicide rates compare between male and female adolescents around the world?</li>

  <li>How do suicide rates for adolescents in the United States compare to other parts of the world?</li>

  <li>How does the rate of human resources for mental health compare to suicide rate for countries around the world? </li>

</ol>

<p>These three questions can help us understand the causes behind suicide rates in adolescents by comparing factors involved in such rates. Overall, analyzing these data comparisons can help to understand which methods are more effective in benefitting young adultsâ€™ mental health.</p>

<h2>About the Dataset</h2>

<p>The data collection and analysis reveals that our data files include different variables such as counties, age and gender. And the main target population analyzed was the suicide data of adolescents (10 to 19 years old). Our data was collected from Twinkle Khanna as well as Kaggle, and most of it is credible as much of the data is certified by WHO or provided by data scientists and analysts. The purpose of all of these websites is to more comprehensively tally up the data and then prevent and alert users who view it in advance.</p>
